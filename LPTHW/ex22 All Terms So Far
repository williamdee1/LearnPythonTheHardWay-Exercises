1) Print "X"
# This prints whatever is in the quotations

2) %X within brackets
# You can assign % to a variable that's defined outside of the quotations
# %s = string, %r = raw variable

3)	\n = new line within string
	\t = tabbed in
	\\ = backslash in string (so it doesn't start a new line)
	

4) raw_input() 
# Prompts the user to input data
# if you write X = raw_input() then the data is stored to a variable
e.g. age = raw_input("How old are you?")

5) from sys import argv
this uses the inputs that the user types in order to return innformation about what is being searched
e.g script, first, second, third = argv
-- script is what is running, then 1st, 2nd and 3rd are the varaible the user inputs
-- print "The script is called:" script...

5) open(filename) | read() | truncate() | len() | write()
	exists() | close()

6) def - defines a function
def 	cheese_and_crackers(cheese_count, boxes_of_crackers):
		print "You have %d cheeses!" % cheese_count
		
		Inside a function the variable is temporary
		So for ex:
		
		def secret_formula(started):
			jelly_beans = started * 500
			jars = jelly_beans / 1000
			crates = jars / 100
			return jelly_beans, jars, crates


start_point = 10000
beans, jars, crates = secret_formula(start_point)

**See above how "started" becomes start_point and jelly_beans becomes "beans"

7) return - returns a value/s from a function
